Wake
From your sleep
The drying of
Your tears
Today
We escape
We escape

Pack
And get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before
All hell
Breaks loose

Breathe
Keep breathing
Don't loose
Your nerve
Breathe
Keep breathing
I can't do this
Alone

Sing
Us a song
A song to keep
Us warm
There's
Such a chill
Such a chill

You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your
Rules and wisdom choke you
